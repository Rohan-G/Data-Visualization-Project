## Driver Head To Head

Drivers cannot be solely compared to all other drivers based on number of wins or number of points in a season. This is because even though driver ability has a part to play in these aspects, the car has a very significant hand in influencing these features. They say that F1 us a team sport. While this may be true, your teammate is the one you absolutely must beat at all costs, as they have the same car as you. If you cannot beat the one with the same car as you, how can you believe that you can stand toe to toe against the best in the world, and deserve to be called the world champion (an unspoken rule in the F1 world - you need to be confident enough to think you are the best in the world).

Hence, we have created a visualization (from the 2003 season onwards) to compare a driver to the sum total of their teammates in terms of points, using 2 distinct line graphs (Line graphs make it easier to visually compare 2 values along with progression over time). The blue line depicts the selected driver's points, and the red line their teammate's. Beside the graph, we placed a picture of the driver and the driver's name. Underneath the picture and name, we have a portion which shows a message. On hovering over one of the lines representing a particular season, we get a message if the driver didn't race in that season, and a points comparison if they did. This gives users a view of how the driver performs compared to other drivers in the same car, and hence provides a better (still not highly accurate) qualitative review of the driver's performance. Hovering over one of the lines (either yours or your teammate's) highlights it (attempting to superimpose it).

Potential Improvements: Add functionality to the points(the circles), add superimposition of lines on hovering, add a legend and label axes, add animation to the lines.
